## About this Package?

Have you ever wished you could keep notes, to-dos, or reminders directly on a GameObject, without switching to another tool?

That’s exactly what Notepad does.

## Features

✔️ **Attach to any MonoBehaviour** as a serialized field    
✔️ **Write and save notes** directly in the Inspector    
✔️ **Notes are stored per object**, keeping context where it matters    
✔️ **Fully editable inside the Unity Editor** – no external tools required

A small feature with a big impact – sometimes the best way to stay organized is simply writing things down where they matter most.
